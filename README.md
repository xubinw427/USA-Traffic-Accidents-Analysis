# Traffic-Accidents-Analysis-and-Prediction

### Introduction

The Traffic Accidents Analysis and Prediction Platform leverages a comprehensive Kaggle dataset to improve road safety through predictive analytics. This platform targets road safety enhancements by identifying high-risk locations and conditions contributing to accidents. It serves a critical role in guiding public policies for traffic management and infrastructure improvement, aiming to reduce the socioeconomic costs associated with road accidents. The project incorporates advanced data processing techniques, including real-time data integration and innovative non-accident data generation, overcoming challenges of incomplete datasets.

The core of the platform is its predictive model, employing XGBoost for its robust performance in handling complex, high-dimensional data and its effectiveness in preventing overfitting. This choice was driven by the need for a model that not only performs well on accuracy metrics but also operates efficiently in a real-time web application environment. The interactive web application, built using Flask and React, allows users to input specific location and weather conditions, providing them with real-time predictions about the likelihood of accidents in their vicinity. This tool significantly enhances user interaction and engagement by visually representing data and predictions, thus making it easier for users to understand and utilize the information for practical safety improvements.
